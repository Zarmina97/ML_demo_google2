# Dataset Analysis: df_train [EDA](eda.ipynb)

## Introduction
Let's analyse just the `df_train` dataset for now. Here are some key observations:

## Observations

- **User ID 1001680** has the **highest purchase count** in the dataset, whereas **User ID 1000708** has the **lowest**.
- **Male customers** have a higher purchase volume and also contribute to a greater financial expenditure overall.
- The **26-35 age bracket** shows the highest quantity of items purchased, yet the expenditure is relatively uniform across all age groups.
- Individuals with **occupation code 4** stand out for purchasing significantly more items, though the spending is fairly consistent across different occupations.
- **City category B** leads in the number of items purchased, while category C exhibits higher spending.
- Residents with a **tenure of 1 year** show the highest number of items purchased, but the spending is comparable up to a tenure of **5+ years**.
- **Single individuals** make more purchases, but the expenditure is comparable to that of individuals who are married.

## Conclusion
These insights provide a valuable understanding of the purchasing patterns within the `df_train` dataset, indicating specific trends in user behavior, demographic preferences, and financial expenditure.
